Pulp OSTree 1.1.0
=================

New Features
------------

- The importer has the capability to pull *all* branches from the :term:`remote` OSTree repository.
  This is controlled using the ``branches`` property in the importer configuration. When
  the ``branches`` property is not specified or has the value of ``nil``, all of the braches
  are pulled. When the ``branches`` property is set to an empty list ``[]``, no branches will
  be pulled. This is useful for users that just want to fetch the ``summary`` information.

- The importer now fetches the ``summary`` file from the remote OSTree repository. The
  ``summary`` file provides a list of branches contained within the remote repository. This
  information is stored in the Pulp repository scratchpad.


API Changes
-----------

- The ``branches`` property in the importer configuration has changed. Previously, the
  default value was an empty list. In this release, the default has been changed to ``nil``
  and the associated behavior is to pull all branches. When the value is an empty list,
  no branches are pulled.
